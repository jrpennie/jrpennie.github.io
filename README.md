# John Pennie | Cybersecurity Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my modern, dark-themed cybersecurity portfolio website. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the website showcases my professional background, projects, documents, technical skills, and contact informationâ€”all presented in a sleek, responsive design with dynamic, flickering star effects on the homepage.

## Features

- **Modern Dark Theme:** A visually striking dark layout with smooth animations.
- **Dynamic Starry Background:** The homepage features a dynamic background with randomly flickering stars to evoke a cosmic atmosphere.
- **Responsive Design:** Fully responsive navigation with a condensed top bar and mobile-friendly hamburger menu.
- **Portfolio Sections:** Separate sections for Home, About, Resume (text-based details), Projects, Documents, Technical Skills, and Contact.
- **Interactive Elements:** Smooth scrolling navigation and basic form validation for the contact form.
- **Custom Favicon:** Uses a custom icon from [this URL](https://pngimg.com/d/hacker_PNG16.png) to display in the browser tab.
